A trivial engine for a small team knowledgebase hosting.

# Use case

This software is written for a rare case where the following conditions were met:
* Windows-based, resource-scarce setup
* A bunch of users with little-to-nothing knowledge of a software
* There will be no person with IT skill on site in foreseeable future.

If you have a person capable of installing and supporting any wiki of CMS engine, use whatever they can, not this PoS.

# Markup and structure

Any page is represented by a directory. There are two type of pages: an article and a catalogue. 

A catalogue page is defined by the file `part.idx` in it. This file contains title and description for the page. Under the descriprion a catalogue page has a list of subcutalogues followed by a list of articles. Physically, both are just subdirectories.

An artice page is defined by a text file in it with the same name as the directory. The file usially contains text, images and links. All this images are usially placed in the same directory.

Both part.idx and *.txt file share the same features. The first line is a title. It's used as a title for a page, a header in a pager and as a representation in a directory.

Use single curly brases to include an image in your text, for example, {pic1-1.jpg}. The form {pic1-1} is also accepted, jpg extention will be assumed.

Use doule curly brases to make a link in a full form: {{link address}link text}, or in a short form: {{link address}}.

Place '-' as a first character in a line to make some kind of a list;
